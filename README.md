# CarWebScraper

The purpose of this project is to conduct a mini-project that encompasses bulk of the data science process — from data collection, data cleaning, up to the exploratory data analysis stage.

## Time to changes

We asked me 2200€ for changing a complete clutch flywheel kit and my car value is around 1400€ maybe more 1000€.

So I decided to look for a used car instead of paying this reparation. I'm not an expert in second-hand car trade, I started looking for a **Land Rover** *Range Rover Sport*, it's a good compromise to live in the countryside. But it's not enough to know which model you want to buy, you have to find it at the right price.

The price depends on the *argus*, which has been the reference for a century to take into account the wear and tear of a car.
But today other sites also offer their own calculation methods. On the other hand, none of them offer a graph to show the second-hand market.
You can only click and scroll through the pages hoping to understand something in the middle of all the selection criteria (fuel, mileage, etc.).

I therefore set myself the objective of carrying out a statistical analysis of classified ads to help me see things more clearly.
